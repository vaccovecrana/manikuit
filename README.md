Cryptocurrency based payment gateway

This project aims to provide a uniform interface for generating and tracking cryptocurrency based payments using
the following backends:

- Bitcoin (via bitcoind).
- Ethereum (via go-ethereum).
- Monero (in progress).

For each backend, you must install and configure each backend package, and enable its RPC interface in order for this
payment gateway to communicate with it correctly.
